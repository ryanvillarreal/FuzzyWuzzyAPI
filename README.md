# FuzzyWuzzyAPI
Fuzzing APIs with Go


This project is meant to provide a interactive console that will allow for the automation of API testing.  
Mainly because I am lazy and want to automate my testing. 


### Why Golang?
Golang is that new hotness and is a great tool to cross-compile for multiple platforms.  Plus I wanted to learn Golang.  

### Why Did You Build It Like This?
idk.  Because i'm a n00b.  If you can do better, feel free to clone and PR.  Or just go use another tool.  

### Building
Building from Go.  Follow the insturctions online to setup Golang in your environment
then `go get github.com/ryanvillarreal/FuzzyWuzzyAPI`.  Once the package has been downloaded
you should be able to `cd ~/go/github/ryanvillarreal/FuzzyWuzzy && go build FuzzyWuzzyAPI`
